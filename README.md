# XyloBot

XyloBot is a bot that I have created for a private discord I am in (no invites, sorry). Still learning a lot about Python, but I feel this bot is at least somewhat decent.

## Features

Mainly just some fun random crap, QOTD, verification system, and AutoReactions.

## Credits

No code was copied directly, but some features of other bots inspired some of the features of Xylo.
