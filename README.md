# XyloBot

XyloBot is a bot that I have created for a private discord I am in (no invites, sorry). Still learning a lot about Python, but I feel this bot is at least somewhat decent.

## Features

Mainly just some fun random crap, QOTD, verification system, and AutoReactions.

## Credits

Open source bots that are extremely cool and helped me understand some really cool stuff.
