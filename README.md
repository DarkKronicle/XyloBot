# XyloBot

XyloBot is a bot that I have created for fun. Still learning a lot about Python, but I feel this bot is at least somewhat decent.

## Features

- Customizable verification. Perfect for IRL discords or for just letting people know who you are.

- Auto Reactions! Have Xylo react to a message using emojis or by sending a new message.

- Your own personal notepad! Keep track of text and retrieve it wherever, whenever. `x>clip`

- Chat games! You can play Cards Against Humanity (Right now it is more like Apples to Apples), create your own quizzes, or play a short game to determine who is faster at typing. More are planned to be added in the future.

- Question of the day. Currently there are only a small select questions, but they are great for keeping your chat active.

- Fun APIs. View the weather, talk like yoda, send a passive aggressive google url, get lines of code are in a GitHub repository, is this for that.

- Seeded randomizers. See how Xylo sees you, see what president you are, and more!

- Basic image manipulation. Add a verify stamp to any image! More are planned to be added in the future.

- Basic text manipulation.

- Utility commands to make your life easier. Create a temporary invite link to a specified channel that gets logged, see emojis that Xylo can find in a text, copy contents of a file to chat, convert text into a text file, grade calculator.
