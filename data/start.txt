Thanks for adding me to {0.name}! I've started by setting your server's default prefix to `>`. To get started here's what you need to know:

`>help` - The help command. It shows *all* commands that you can use, and the usage on how to use it. You can also get more specific help per command. Commands with `!` in front are for configuration, so you'll probably want to start there.

`>!settings` - This is how you configure what the prefix and other general settings. I highly recommend setting up `>!settings announcements` so that you can get news if I have changed.

`>!verify` - Get verification on your server setup! You will then use the `>auth` command to verify users.

`>!commandconfig` - Disable certain commands for the whole server or just for a channel.

`>!utility` - Configure different utility commands.

`>!autoreactions` - Have me automagically react to messages that contain certain keywords. I can react with messages, or reactions! There are already some preset ones that you can view with `>autoreactions`!
